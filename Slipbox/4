Section 12.7 in How to Take Smart Notes poses that restrictions on a system facilitate creativity by limiting decisions. What is interesting here is that the emphasis on the advantage it gives our mind is subtly different than just giving our mind more willpower* to use by not making other decisions. Not only do these restrictions free the mind from spending willpower on decisions already made, we somehow get to be more creative by treating some things as a given or constant.
