Willpower is a small but renewable resource. Decisions use this resource. Conserving willpower can be implemented by removing decisions from a system. A system that has fewer decisions will move forward faster. Agile software development is an example implementation of this concept. In agile software development, a product manager prioritizes and assigns work to engineers. This abstracts away the decision of what to work on so the engineers can use more decisions on work of higher complexity thus increasing system efficiency.
