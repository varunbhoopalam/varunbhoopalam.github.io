Uncertainty is a factor of how many decisions have to be made. More decisions can lead to more uncertainty. Many decisions block progress as great uncertainty about the results of future decisions can deter decision-makers from acting out of fear. Thus reducing decisions someone has to make in a given time can lead to more efficient actions and results.
