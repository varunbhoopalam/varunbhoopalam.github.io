A mistake can be more important to long term success than something successful. This is because we can learn from mistakes and perform better in the future. Therefore, allowing members of your team to make mistakes and learn from them and sharing your own mistakes is a very efficient action. It builds a foundation of trust and learning from the mistake elevates makes the collective more knowledgable.
