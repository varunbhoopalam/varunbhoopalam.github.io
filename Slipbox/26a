Participation and Collaboration is a category of data visualization interaction techniques that enable more than 1 user to contribute to the understanding and interpretation of a visualization. This leads to higher engagements from users and different insights derived from the data. This could be motivated from the idea that sensemaking and data interpretation tend to be social activities.
