The Ziegarnik effect is the tendency to remember interrupted or incomplete tasks more easily than tasks that have been completed or marked for later. This Ziegarnik effect is interesting because it is a tool that can be utilized in more than one way. We can let tasks linger in thought and problem solve in the background while not actively working on the unfinished tasks. We can also have a clear mind to solve other problems by resolving the presently unfinshed tasks or marking them to be resolved later.
