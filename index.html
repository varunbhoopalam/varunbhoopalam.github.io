                        An Execution Context is the environment that JavaScript code runs in. Execution Contexts are
                        comprised of the global object, the 'this'(link to this concept) variable, a reference to the
                        outer environment, and the code to be executed.
                        <br>
                        When the JavaScript compiler starts to work through a file, it creates a Global Execution
                        Context. The Global Execution Context is the base Execution Context. In the browser, the Global
                        Execution Context will have the window object be both 'this' and the Global Object. The outer
                        environment is null. The code to be executed will be what code is in the file.
