Methane emissions are a leading factor contributing to climate change. Fred Krupp and co are launching a satellite to track these emissions across the globe and make this data publicly available and easy to access. Their goal is to reduce emissions by 45% by 2025. They think this is the course of action to do this for the following reasons. Reducing methane emissions is one the of the most impactful actions they can take. When a leak is identified, it is usually simple and low cost to fix. People are incentivized to help and fix these leaks when this data is provided to them. He speculates this is one of the lowest cost, highly effective ways to combat climate.
