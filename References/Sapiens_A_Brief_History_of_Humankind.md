**An animal of no significance**

Sapien's 70000 years of history, the study of culture/human social structures, is short compared to the 14 billions of years after the big bang. Similarly, evan a view of the genus Homo shows that sapiens are in their infancy compared to other species of Homo.

It is uncertain why sapiens rose to dominance and through assimilation or genocide, sapiens are the only species of Homo still in existence. Some sapiens today are uneasy over the fact that there were other species of humans in existence or the notion that sapiens rose to dominance over other species of Homo perhaps by a series of stochastic events rather than coalescing as a superior being.

**The tree of knowledge**

The cognitive revolution gave sapiens dominance over other species on the planet. This could be because sapiens communication evolved to be flexible enough to cooperate at larger scales than small tribes. The vehicle of this was humans new ability to gossip, talk about others. This could also/alternatively be driven by sapiens gaining the ability to talk about fictional things. This unlocked cooperation on a much larger scale. 

Fictional entities can have power and exert force on the real world. Fiction broke the limit factor on how cooperation and social systems evolved and changed over time. Without ficiton, cooperation advancements were driven by biological changes. With fiction cooperation advancements could be culture driven. At it's root, these cooperation advancements allows for trust without intimate knowledge of another. Sapiens don't walk on the moon or fly in the sky without these cooperation advancements.

**A day in the life of Adam and Eve**

We don't know what Sapien life was like tens of thousands of years ago but we have some general knowledge. We care because present day social and psychological characteristics were shaped from sapiens time as hunters and gatherers. Sapiens then could have been considered groups of affluent societies that had long life spans and a lot of time for leisure not needing much relative time for survival compared to the agricultural age humans.

**The flood**

Sapiens caused mass exinction as they spread around the world. They could have done this by altering environments they entered and hunting. Evidence for this activity is suggested by fossil records of animals associated to sapien presence. A constant since the cognitive revolution is that sapiens have caused ecological disaster everywhere they went.

**History's biggest fraud**

THe agricultural revolution increased the world population ath the cost of quality of life. It is thought that no human actively decided to trade quality of life for the benefits of agriculture, but it was a force that once set in motion was irreversible. This force was thought to be set in motion by sapien's motivation for an easier life. The dichtomy of this revolution, work harder for a lower quality of life, is still reflected today by the iron law of history. Luxuries turn into necessities and the accompanying change may not increase quality of life but definately spawn new obligations. Another theory to why sapiens began embracign agriculture was to support building monuments that spanned generations perhaps for spiritual or religious purposes.

From an evolutionary perspective, domesticated animals and plants thrived from the agricultural evolution. There were more copies of their dna than ever before. From an individual perspective, this has led animals to lead cruel, punishing lives at the expense of humans.

**Building pyramids**

For the first time, the agricultural revolution gave sapiens reasons to think about the future. During the agricultural revolution, large scale cooperation was often the effort of many to the benefit of few. This large scale communication was made possible by imagined orders. Imagined orders require true believers to perpetuate and exert force on the world like orchestration of mass-cooperation of sapiens. These believers are created and perpetuated by a couple of phenomenon. The imagined order is embedded in the real world. The imagined order shapes human desires. The imagined order is inter-objective. Imagined orders are probably here to stay. To remove an imagined order, countless people must stop believing in the imagined order. To get that many people to cooperate, you probably need an imagined order. Perhaps a way to break this cycle will come in an evolution in sapiens.

**Memory overload**

Writing was invented to address human brains inadequacy for storing and processing large amounts of mathematical data. Evolutionary pressures pushed sapien cognative capabilities to focus on social, botanical, zoological, and topographic information. The ability to process and store high quantities of mathematical data is not coded into our genes the way breathing and walking is, thus writing. Initial writing was thought to be partial-script meant to solve for inadequacies of the spoken language. Systems of retrieval and cataloguing have shaped the way humans think from free association and retrieval to compartmentalization and burocracy. Today, the language of numbers shapes and is the most powerful language in the world. Binary code and mathematical notation dominate our existence. 

**There is no justice in history**

One iron law of history is that hierarchies justify themselves through divine absolution, not from their actual fictional beginnings. Most sociological hierarchies lack a logical or bilogical motivation. They are usually chance events perpetuated by myths. Concepts like castes and purity have been used to maintain hierarchies. Hierarchies are maintained by punishing individuals from deviating from their given role. The most commonly found hierarchy in history is between male and female. Sex is biological, gender is a cultural construct and constantly evolving. It is not understood why patriarchal societies have dominated history.

**The arrow of history**

Human culture is constantly in flux. Even a culture left to it's own devices without external influence shifts over time. Cultures are a product of cognitive dissonance and conflicting ideals. This can explain this shift over time. Through the ocurse of history, cultures have trended towards homogeneity. This line of thiking challenges notions of authenticism in culture as people view it today. The three biggest mergers of culture were money, imperialism, and religion in probably that order.

**The scent of money**

Money is a universal medium of exchange that allows the conversion of any good or service into another. This property of money is enabled by money's quality of being universally desired. Money is a psychological construct that can be easily moved, stored, and exchanged. Money's value is determined by the belief that it has value. It is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever created. However, the system of trust extends to just money itself, not to the individuals wielding in the money. Money played a significant role in joining and aligning interests pushing human cultures towards unification.

**Imperial visions**

Most people today are the offspring of an empire. Empire is defined by controlling multiple, diverse people/cultures and having flexible borders. There are many different origins of empires in history; conquest, marriage, and democratic to name a few. Empires have a lasting cultural impression long after their death. Empires swallow distinct cultures and produce homogenous cultures. This is evident from the imperial languages that most speak today. An ideaology present in all empires is taht the empire is the one universal truth in the world and the empire is good for all people. Empire cycles look like conqered people assimilating into the empire until viewed as equals and rinse and repeat. In this cycle there is a give and take in cultural identity on both sides. Because most people come from a succession of empires, the concept of authentic cultures removed from empire influence is difficult to find. 

**The law of religion**

Religion is a sstem of human norms and values founded on a belief in a superhuman order. Religions that merge cultures and unify humankind are universal and missionary. One religious origin was as a contract to control what humans could not control. Theist religions popular today like Islam and Christianity have borrowed concepts from other dualistic, polytheistic religions to create sycretic religions and by consequence, a powerful uniting force of human culture. Humanist religions sanctify humanity. Examples of these are Budhism, capitalism, and communism.

**The secret of success**

History seems to be driven by a stochastic (not deterministic) series of events. Thus, implying why events happened is very hard. This is further muddled by history being a level 2 chaotic system, one that reacts to predictions about itself. Why study history then? To embed the udnerstanding that what sits before us is neither natural, nor inevitable. History/culture can be viewed from memetics perspective; a cultures goal is not to benefit humankind, but to spread itself infecting as many hosts as possible like a mental parasite.

**The discovery of ignorance**

Since the scientific revolution, human power has grown exponentially. The scientific revolution was a cognitive revolution in which humans collectively learned to embrace ignorance on important questinos for the first time. Science collects observations and uses these to construct theories. Statistics was developed to understand and predict phenomenon too complex for simple mathematical formulae. Sciences advancement is not measured in veracity, but in capabilities. The idea that life could change for the better through advancement in human capabilities was thought heretical by most cultures before the scientific revolution. This gave a humans a change in scope of what to work on, from accepting and trying to explain phenomenon to progress and trying to control phenomenon. Economic, political, and religious forces drive much of the direction of scientific advances/the scientific agenda. Science flourishes when paired with a religion or ideology which justify huge scientific cost to further it's own agenda.

**The marriage of science and empire**

Europeans (specifically Britain, France, and USA) may have started global dominance because they had the advantage of a scientific mindset and capitalist framework. Admitance of ignorance and quest for knowledge were advantages in a world where most cultures assumed the knew what they needed to know. This is supported by european incomplete/partial maps that admit ignorance of what lay beyond known territory. Europeans used science to provide imperial conquests with practical knowledge, technology, and ideological justification. In turn, scientists were provided aveneus to explore and funding to do so.

**The capitalist creed**

The most important economic resource is trust in the future.

The scientific revolutoin improved humans trust in the future. This enabled credit instruments to tap into future ventures and allowed economics high growth. Capitalism's creed is "profit made off of investment should be re-invested in the investment to make more profit." This mindest influences ideaology to suggest that economic growth/GDP is the supreme good to maximize. Capitalism has relied on ontinued technological innovation to justify credit lines/and economy built on the promise of the future. Capitalism also shaped and influenced imperial conquest. Imperial conquest was driven by the means to fund the conquest. Capitalism encouraged growth where there was stable government and credit was repaid building trust in the future. Thus, countries that built trust in the future performed well in conquest. One instrument used to finance conquest was stock, a means to distribute risk such that one person doesn't have to incur risk of a venture alone. Stock encouraged and facilitated easier financial investment in the future. The idea that the free market is a rising tide that elevates all those that interact with it has been untrue at times in practice. The slave trade and exploitation of humans in congo were a direct result of capitalism and their lives were made worse.
