**An animal of no significance**

Sapien's 70000 years of history, the study of culture/human social structures, is short compared to the 14 billions of years after the big bang. Similarly, evan a view of the genus Homo shows that sapiens are in their infancy compared to other species of Homo.

It is uncertain why sapiens rose to dominance and through assimilation or genocide, sapiens are the only species of Homo still in existence. Some sapiens today are uneasy over the fact that there were other species of humans in existence or the notion that sapiens rose to dominance over other species of Homo perhaps by a series of stochastic events rather than coalescing as a superior being.

**The tree of knowledge**

The cognitive revolution gave sapiens dominance over other species on the planet. This could be because sapiens communication evolved to be flexible enough to cooperate at larger scales than small tribes. The vehicle of this was humans new ability to gossip, talk about others. This could also/alternatively be driven by sapiens gaining the ability to talk about fictional things. This unlocked cooperation on a much larger scale. 

Fictional entities can have power and exert force on the real world. Fiction broke the limit factor on how cooperation and social systems evolved and changed over time. Without ficiton, cooperation advancements were driven by biological changes. With fiction cooperation advancements could be culture driven. At it's root, these cooperation advancements allows for trust without intimate knowledge of another. Sapiens don't walk on the moon or fly in the sky without these cooperation advancements.

**A day in the life of Adam and Eve**

We don't know what Sapien life was like tens of thousands of years ago but we have some general knowledge. We care because present day social and psychological characteristics were shaped from sapiens time as hunters and gatherers. Sapiens then could have been considered groups of affluent societies that had long life spans and a lot of time for leisure not needing much relative time for survival compared to the agricultural age humans.

**The flood**

Sapiens caused mass exinction as they spread around the world. They could have done this by altering environments they entered and hunting. Evidence for this activity is suggested by fossil records of animals associated to sapien presence. A constant since the cognitive revolution is that sapiens have caused ecological disaster everywhere they went.

**History's biggest fraud**

THe agricultural revolution increased the world population ath the cost of quality of life. It is thought that no human actively decided to trade quality of life for the benefits of agriculture, but it was a force that once set in motion was irreversible. This force was thought to be set in motion by sapien's motivation for an easier life. The dichtomy of this revolution, work harder for a lower quality of life, is still reflected today by the iron law of history. Luxuries turn into necessities and the accompanying change may not increase quality of life but definately spawn new obligations. Another theory to why sapiens began embracign agriculture was to support building monuments that spanned generations perhaps for spiritual or religious purposes.

From an evolutionary perspective, domesticated animals and plants thrived from the agricultural evolution. There were more copies of their dna than ever before. From an individual perspective, this has led animals to lead cruel, punishing lives at the expense of humans.

**Building Pyramids**

For the first time, the agricultural revolution gave sapiens reasons to think about the future. During the agricultural revolution, large scale cooperation was often the effort of many to the benefit of few. This large scale communication was made possible by imagined orders. Imagined orders require true believers to perpetuate and exert force on the world like orchestration of mass-cooperation of sapiens. These believers are created and perpetuated by a couple of phenomenon. The imagined order is embedded in the real world. The imagined order shapes human desires. The imagined order is inter-objective. Imagined orders are probably here to stay. To remove an imagined order, countless people must stop believing in the imagined order. To get that many people to cooperate, you probably need an imagined order. Perhaps a way to break this cycle will come in an evolution in sapiens.
