**An Animal of No Significance**

Sapien's 70000 years of history, the study of culture/human social structures, is short compared to the 14 billions of years after the big bang. Similarly, evan a view of the genus Homo shows that sapiens are in their infancy compared to other species of Homo.

It is uncertain why sapiens rose to dominance and through assimilation or genocide, sapiens are the only species of Homo still in existence. Some sapiens today are uneasy over the fact that there were other species of humans in existence or the notion that sapiens rose to dominance over other species of Homo perhaps by a series of stochastic events rather than coalescing as a superior being.
