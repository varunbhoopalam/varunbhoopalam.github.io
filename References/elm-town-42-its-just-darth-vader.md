Aziz Erkal is the guest of this episode. He created [Kite, an interactive visualiztion tool for graph theory](https://github.com/erkal/kite). Graph theory is the study of graphs where graphs are a mathematical structure to represent relationships between objects. This manifests as a collection of edges and vertices which can be used to model many parts of life like social networks. Erkal is a mathemetician who wanted to an interactive graphing tool to help him in his work. He started to build this tool in javascript but was slowed down for a couple of reasons. Coming from mathematics, an imperative language like Javascript where the state of the variable could change confused him. He moved to Elm to be more in his comfort zone working with a declarative language. Because he didn't know what exactly he wanted to build as he was building, the freedom that came with re-factoring in Elm was beneficial. D3.js is the biggest known graphical library for the front end and he used that to interoperate with Elm at first before eventually re-factoring to use only Elm as dependencies for his tool He found the elm-geometry and elm-ui great libraries to work with in Elm and was encouraged by talks from the Elm founder and major contributor, Evan and Richard. He benefit a lot from the elm-community so he decided to make one of the latest features for Elm itself to give back to the community.
