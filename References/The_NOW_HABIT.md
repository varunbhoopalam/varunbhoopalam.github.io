Why do we procrastinate? We procrastinate to cope with fear/anxiety over starting/completing tasks. This fear/anxiety can be rooted in different places in our ego. Procrastination can be rewarding and serve temporary relief in the face of our fears. A fear of failure, fear of success, gaining percieved control, and expressing resentment are all root causes of procrastination. 

People are often bad at time management and truly assessing how much time has passed in situations that are emotionally charged. This can lead to a lack of awareness over procrastination patterns since procrastination is tied with fear. Gaining awareness over these patterns can turn percieved wasted time to percieved productive time. 

A resilient self worth protects against procrastination as procrastination can be used to protect our self worth. If I tied my self worth into my activities and percieved success of those activities, I can protect this self worth by not giving myself the proper time to engage with the activity and procrastinate instead. This way I do not allowing myself to see what the output of work would have been at 100% capacity and thus my self worth doesn't deprecate if the work turned out below my standard. 

How we talk to ourselves has an impact on our subsequent actions. Negative self talk puts someone into a victim mindset, removes percieved control over situations, and diverts energy from the task at hand to thoughts of what to do if they ahd control of the situation and were not a victim. Negative self statements are generally started with "I have to" or "I should." Positive self talk gives control back to the individual and removes core reasons for procrastination. These generally start with "I am" or "I will."

Large projects and high amounts of uncertainty can lead to action paralysis and procrastination. A pattern to deal with that is to break down bigger tasks towards smaller, easier to digest tasks with a focus on starting work when possible rather than having it complete by a certain time. This pattern restores focus and action.

Procrastinators and workaholics are trapped in a cycle of working or feeling guilty about not working. Guilt free play can break this cycle. Play is important to re-energize and re-vitalize the mind and body. Play is what teaches children the excitement of discovery and showcases humans innate creativeness. Everything is play to a child and learning needs no motivation in that mindset. Later in life adults are taught that work is hard and painful. People reach for procrastination as relief from this pain. 

The pull method of motivation capitalizes on human tendency to be motivated to work productively when incentivezed with pleasure and success as a reward rather than the push method which is characterized by working to avoid pain. Often when people are motivated with the push method, procrastination is reached for to avoid pain rather than working to avoid pain.

Coupling guilt free play with the pull method of motivation can maximize time spent on focused, quality work. 

Guilt free play is also conducive to taking advantage of the Ziegarnik effect, letting the subconcious mind work on problems not put down in the background while the concious mind is occupied.

Fear of failure, terror of being overwhelmed, and fear of finishing are al fears that lead to inaction. These fears have multiplicative effect on one another. It's possible to overcome these fears with a systematic approach. If overwhelmed, take smaller steps. If you fear failure, expose your fear. Fear finishing, expose your fear. These all move to language and actions of producers.

Systems/Systematic behavior is successful at giving control over an indivdual's behavior. The UNSCHEDULE is a system meant to give the perception of control back to the suer as awell as foster an attitude of guilt free play, emphasis on starting rather than finishing, clarity around how time is used and how much is available, and uses methods from psychology to get there.
1) Schedule only
  - Previously commited time such as meals, sleep, meetings
  - Freetime, recreation, leisure reading
  - Socializing, lunches, and dinner with friends
  - Health activities
  - Routing structured events
2) Fill in Unschedule with work on projects only after you complete one half hour
3) Take credit for periods of work that represent 30 minutes of uninterrupted work
4) Reward yourself with a break of change to a more enjoyable task after each period worked
5) Keep track of # of quality hours worked each day/week
6) Always leave one full day a week for recreation and small chores
7) Before deciding on recreation or social commitment, take 30 minutes for project
8) Focus on starting
9) Think small
10) Keep starting
11) Never end "down"

Our brain has two functions/states. Survival function and creative function. The focus and concentration needed to do quality work motivates using the flow state. This is when our creative function takes over and we reach heightened levels of calm, focus, and attention. It is possible to reach this state at will by daily meditation and training. This states puts aside the critical and logical survival function of our brain to focus on creativity. This release the mind from the constraints of the survival function. (What are the constraints of the survival function?) The creative function can create wider ideas that can be the first draft/steps to quality work. Taking the time to get into the flow state before critical meetings, critical work, or job interviews can lead to success with those tasks.

Individuals who expect and embrace setbacks often experience higher levels of success. We can train ourselves to not be ovewhelmed by setbacks and embrace them, it is not an innate trait that cannot be changed. One method of traiing is to artificially plan a setback and conciously listen and pay attention to how we are feeling during the setback. Familiarizing ourselves with this feeling can give the necessary familiarity and experience necessary to recognize setbacks in real time and embrace them. This will slowly change negative habits into positive habits from the view of a producer. Mental rehearsal in general is an effective tool to unlock optimized performance or uncover blockers in work. 

Distractions while working can impede progress. Helpful patterns to work with distractions are to confront them or compartmentalize them/"put them down" with the ziegarnik effect telling your mind to release the thoughts as you will deal with it later. 

Goals are a good tool to add agency to work and provide an impetus for quality work. Identifying goals that are worth striving towards in the first place is a worthwhile endeavor as this will give the motivation necessary for work. Helpful goals are measurable as in you can identify progress on them and if they are achieved. Helpful goals are also usually able to be broken down into subgoals. These goal characteristics help utilize the pull method of motiviation and identify measurable points of progress that can then reward the goal setter and worker.

Working with procrastinators in life requires empathy. Empathy is used to understand a procrastinators root causes for procrastination and work with them with those root causes in mind. Using language of a producer along with techniques like constructive feedback, clear communication, rewards for success, and decisiveness will help procrastinators as a support for them to tackle the underlying issues of procrastination and set them up for success.
