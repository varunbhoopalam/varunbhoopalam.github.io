Why do we procrastinate? We procrastinate to cope with fear/anxiety over starting/completing tasks. This fear/anxiety can be rooted in different places in our ego. Procrastination can be rewarding and serve temporary relief in the face of our fears. A fear of failure, fear of success, gaining percieved control, and expressing resentment are all root causes of procrastination. 

People are often bad at time management and truly assessing how much time has passed in situations that are emotionally charged. This can lead to a lack of awareness over procrastination patterns since procrastination is tied with fear. Gaining awareness over these patterns can turn percieved wasted time to percieved productive time. 

A resilient self worth protects against procrastination as procrastination can be used to protect our self worth. If I tied my self worth into my activities and percieved success of those activities, I can protect this self worth by not giving myself the proper time to engage with the activity and procrastinate instead. This way I do not allowing myself to see what the output of work would have been at 100% capacity and thus my self worth doesn't deprecate if the work turned out below my standard. 

How we talk to ourselves has an impact on our subsequent actions. Negative self talk puts someone into a victim mindset, removes percieved control over situations, and diverts energy from the task at hand to thoughts of what to do if they ahd control of the situation and were not a victim. Negative self statements are generally started with "I have to" or "I should." Positive self talk gives control back to the individual and removes core reasons for procrastination. These generally start with "I am" or "I will."

Large projects and high amounts of uncertainty can lead to action paralysis and procrastination. A pattern to deal with that is to break down bigger tasks towards smaller, easier to digest tasks with a focus on starting work when possible rather than having it complete by a certain time. This pattern restores focus and action.

Procrastinators and workaholics are trapped in a cycle of working or feeling guilty about not working. Guilt free play can break this cycle. Play is important to re-energize and re-vitalize the mind and body. Play is what teaches children the excitement of discovery and showcases humans innate creativeness. Everything is play to a child and learning needs no motivation in that mindset. Later in life adults are taught that work is hard and painful. People reach for procrastination as relief from this pain. 

The pull method of motivation capitalizes on human tendency to be motivated to work productively when incentivezed with pleasure and success as a reward rather than the push method which is characterized by working to avoid pain. Often when people are motivated with the push method, procrastination is reached for to avoid pain rather than working to avoid pain.

Coupling guilt free play with the pull method of motivation can maximize time spent on focused, quality work. 

Guilt free play is also conducive to taking advantage of the Ziegarnik effect, letting the subconcious mind work on problems not put down in the background while the concious mind is occupied.

Fear of failure, terror of being overwhelmed, and fear of finishing are al fears that lead to inaction. These fears have multiplicative effect on one another. It's possible to overcome these fears with a systematic approach. If overwhelmed, take smaller steps. If you fear failure, expose your fear. Fear finishing, expose your fear. These all move to language and actions of producers.

Systems/Systematic behavior is successful at giving control over an indivdual's behavior. The UNSCHEDULE is a system meant to give the perception of control back to the suer as awell as foster an attitude of guilt free play, emphasis on starting rather than finishing, clarity around how time is used and how much is available, and uses methods from psychology to get there.
