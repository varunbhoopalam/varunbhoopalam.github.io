Make Data Structures is a live talk by Richard Feldman found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1FU3e0sT1I)

Richard compares and contrasts different ways of building software applications. Building with blocks is an OOP style where components are built in isolation and then stitched together. In this approach, isolated problems are higher priorities than structural problems. This can be a problem as structural problems have a high cost to fix when the code is already implemented. Richard advocates in Elm to create data structures before writing any code. This is a thought exercise where you solve for structural problems before problems in isolation solving for the previous problem. This involves going through a cycle of building, discovering, and re-structuring until the structure can be realized with implementation. In Elm, building data structures can be done by mapping project requirements to custom types and further refining handcrafted/union types until structural problems are solved. He asks to default to "opaque", cannot be modified, types with accessors and mappers instead of allowing use of the implementation. 

He brings in one more semi-unrelated theme of learning by doing. He thinks one of the best ways to learn is to just learn by getting deep in code without knowing what is proper and figuring out the proper way to do things later.
