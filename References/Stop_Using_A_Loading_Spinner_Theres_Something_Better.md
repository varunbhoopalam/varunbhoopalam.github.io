Loading spinners are often a poor experience for users for a variety of reasons.
- No feedback to the user on time left ot load or progress
This could provoke an emotional response from a user
- Emotions affect our sense of time.
A user could percieve more time has passed that in reality has
- Content loaded after spinner could surprise the user.
Surprising the user is a risk as this could be a negative experience for a user.

Good progress indicators
1) Give immediate feedback
2) *Provide a sense of time (how much has progressed and is pending)
3) Removes doubt (gradual progress reassures people app is working)

Patterns to replace loading spinner
- Skeleton Screen - A blank version of the UI loaded incrementally
- Progressive Loading for images - Load a low quality version of image to serve immediately and load in high quality version of image in background and transition to the image once loaded

*Connection here between push and pull motivation methods. Skeleton screen shifts the focus of attention of the user. Corresponding to pull model, this makes user focus on a positive (progress) than a wait time (negative).
