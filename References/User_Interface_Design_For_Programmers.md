Principle 1: A well designed user interface behaves exactly as the user expects it to. This is motivated by maintaining the happiness of a user. Tools that do not behave as expected can cause a user to feel helplessness and not in control of their environment. This leads to unhappiness as described by the pyschological phenomenon, learned helplessness. There are two important concepts when discussing user expectations. The user model is a user's idea of how a program works. The program model is how it actually works. Talking to users and conducting experiments with users is often the best way to discover the user model. It's often much harder to change the user model and much easier to change the program model to adhere to the user model. 


Principle 2: Every option given to the user is a choice the user has to make. Making choices isn't inherantly bad, but making choices about something the user doesn't care about is certainly bad. 


When the user model is not well defined, metaphors and affordances are techniques to help shape and guide the user model. 


In practice, users often exhibit these behaviors:
- Users hate reading
- Users can't use the mouse very well
- Users can't remember anything


Activity Based Planning is designing a ui around activities a user intends to do with the application. This is in contrast designing around the capabilities of an app. Activity Based Planning is meant to have user centric design and make these activities as easy for the user to do as possible.
