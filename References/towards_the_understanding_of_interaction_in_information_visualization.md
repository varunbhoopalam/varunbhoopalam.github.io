Data visualization is as a tool to help give meaning and insight to abstract data. This paper proposes that interaction is a part of data visualization. The effect on cognition/understanding when interaction is introduced to data visualization is varied not causuly known. This paper proposes that one reason for this is that the world does not have a wholistic view of what interaction is and encompases. There are a few reasons for this. Data visualization techniques continue to evolve and grow. As of 2015, there is no accepted standard for data visualization categories. To have a holistic view of interaction, this paper attempts to solve the lack of categorizing in visualization. For refererence, the visualizations Ana collected are documented [here](https://rethinkingvis.com/#all).

### Interaction Categories
1. <strong>Filter:</strong> This enables a user to reduce complexity to help cognitive load or to focus in on details. This is usually done by specifying a range of condition. Long delays between user filter request and machine response have shown to be detrimental to user experience and negatively affects user insight derived from the visualization.

2. <strong>Select:</strong> This enables a user to mark or track items of interest. This technique is often used in conjunction with others. For example, when an item is selected often that action is coupled with changing the visual representation of the data or offering details on demand, more detailed information about the selection.

3. <strong>Abstract/Elaborate:</strong> This enables a user to change the level of detail/abstraction for interpretation. <strong>Zooming</strong> allows users to remove detail/data points from view and show more detail about selected data points. Zooming out does the reverse and adds previously hidden contextual information back to the viewport. This helps aid cognition in recognizing meaningful patterns within data. <strong>Details on Demand</strong> provides users additional information upon a selection, often a click or hover state. Drill down options in tree diagrams use this technique.

4. <strong>Overview and Explore:</strong> This enables a user to see the entire represntation of a dataset. This can allow for insight that was only possible with the entire context of a datasets shape. Due to dataset size and other technological constraints, representing all data in a visualization may not be possible. Panning can be introduced when this constraint exists. This can be likened to a camera moving across a larger visualization. Often, there is a visualization to show how much of the entire visualization is being covered by the current viewport.

5. <strong>Connect/Relate:</strong> This enables a user to more clearly see view relationships between data. THis can manifest as highlighting similar data across multiple different graphs or physically linking data with highlights.

6. <strong>History:</strong> This enables a user to see the history of their interactions and potentially undo their interactions chronologically. This is highly associated to the exploration of data within a visualization. This aids a user to refine insight and make mistakes which can save user time. This also frees users from fear of not getting back to a certain view and can give users the freedom of exploring data further.

7. <strong>Extraction:</strong> This makes it easier for users to save or share derived insight from data visualization. This can manifest as translating query parameters across visualization or exporting content to different mediums.

8. <strong>Refigure and Encode:</strong> This gives user more direct control over the visualization to tranform it to gain insight. Possible examples of these techniques are allowing a user to change spatial reprentation of the data by ordering ascending when it was descending data points. This can also manifest as changing data groupings and colors.
