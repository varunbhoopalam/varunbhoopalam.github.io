The Tom's story is about a company that helps fight poverty by giving a pair of shoes to someone for every shoe sold. Blake believes in the power of story. He argues that a good story is an effective way to influence people. That could be influencing them to care and buy your product or work with you. He asks for the reader to find the story they care about, refine it and share it with everyone.` 

Fear is the apprehension of future events. Fear can influence us into not taking actions we ewant to do. Fear is ineveitable. Our response to fear is not. There are many techniques and ways to overcome fear. You can find situations that mirror the one you're fearful about and see the results to lessen uncertainty about your own situation. Transfer the fear from inside the mind to another medium like spoken or written to get a new perspective on the fear and impact of fear. Waiting for the right time to act may be a poor strategy as this stems from fear of acting.

Be resourceful without needing resources. A lack of resources can make shape decision making positively as this situation reinforces ingenuity and frugality. A lack of resource at onset can even be correlated to future success of a project/company. Traditional things like office space are not neccessary to succeed today.

Simplicity makes business easier. Simplicity makes decision making easier, working with others easier, and communicating about your business easier. Simplicity offers clarity of thought not just in business but in the personal life as well. This clarity of thought can spur the individual to action and allows them to focus on their values.

Higher levels of trust in and about a company is correlated to higher levels of success. Trust is built over time. A leader can foster a culture of trust by embodying the "servant leader," leading through empathy rather than authoritarian practices. Transparency can be a key element to foster trust. Giving individuals autonomy and room to make and learn from mistakes can be critical to building trust. Actions that break trust can be devastating to a company and fixing this mistake can be very costly. 

Charitable work as a core part of the business is advantageous as people have a predisposition to want to work for and be part of charitable work. There is also great personal satisfaction for many people in giving back. The best time to make charitable work a core part of the business is at the very beginning so it is part of the DNA of the company. Give early, give often and give thoughtfully. Money is fine to give but think about the core competency of your business and try to be charitable in that way. For example, a shoe company can donate shoes to poverty stricken countries rather than give money to a foundation in that country. The advantages here are a greater sense of engagement and sustainable effort.

Start something that matters. If you haven't started already, start today.
