Jose's motivation is to become a good software engineer. To be a good software engineer, you have to be a good thinker. Jose implies that at a certain point in his journey, becoming a better problem solver was not his limiting factor. His limiting factor was time and effort spent engaging with the actual problem he was working on solving. His number one distraction limiting time spent on solving the problem was the ego. The ego as a distraction was tying himself to the problem in some way. This resulted in distraction from the problem to his relationship to the problem and metadata around the problem. Rather than focusing on the problem, he could be focused on if he was smart enough to solve it or giving focusing on other easier tasks to inflate the ego. Relative deprivation is a phenomenon of dermining effort level by relative standing to peers. Effort level increases as relative standing to peers is greater. The Beginner's Mind is a way of stopping the ego from distracting to the problem. Beginners mind is the mindset of the life-long student. The beginner knows there is more to learn and becomes a sponge for knowledge basing findings on observations rather than pre-conceptions. Distancing self from the problem/task can disarm the ego distraction. This can manifest as "What is the bug?" rather than "Did I cause the bug?".
