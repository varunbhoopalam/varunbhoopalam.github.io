Jose's motivation is to become a good software engineer. To be a good software engineer, is to be a good thinker. At a certain point in Jose's journey, becoming a better problem solver was not his limiting factor to being a better thinker. His limiting factor was time and effort spent engaging with the actual problem he was working on solving. 

His ego was hist number one distraction limiting to engaging more with problems he faces. The ego conflates self with the problem. This resulted in distraction. Instead of problem-solving, the ego forced Jose to focus on how he was related to the problem. Jsoe could be questioning if he was smart enough to solve it or shifting focus to easier tasks to inflate the ego. 

The beginners mind is a way of removing the ego as a distraction. Beginners mind is the mindset of the life-long student. The beginner is a sponge for knowledge. The expert makes judgements and decisions on previous knowledge. The beginner uses what is available and adds to their understanding. Distancing ego-self from the problem/task can disarm the ego distraction. This can manifest as "What is the bug?" rather than "Did I cause the bug?".
